# Email Template Builder Component Library

Welcome to the Email Template Builder component library. This Storybook provides a comprehensive guide to all the components used in our email template builder application.

## Component Categories

Our components are organized into the following categories:

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, and color pickers
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms that form more complex UI elements
- **Organisms**: Complex components that combine multiple molecules and atoms
- **Templates**: Pre-defined layouts and structures
- **Templates**: Complete, ready-to-use components

## Getting Started

To use these components in your application:

1. Import the component from its respective path
2. Use the component with the appropriate props
3. Refer to the documentation for each component for detailed usage instructions

## Design Principles

Our components follow these design principles:

- **Consistency**: Components maintain a consistent look and feel
- **Accessibility**: All components are designed with accessibility in mind
- **Flexibility**: Components can be customized through props
- **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reused across the application

## Theme Support

All components support both light and dark themes. You can toggle between themes using the theme switcher in the toolbar.
